# Plan

Like mentionned in the 'Contribute' file, only bug fixing pull request are accepted at the moment. 

In a first time, there a big work to improve the platform:

- Drop useless packages
- Define a clean protocol (and maybe drop the json encoding?)
- Improve socket management
- Improve security (actually set security rules)
- Rewrite the remote with another framework if necessary (React?)
- Improve remote experience (any UX ideas?)
- Build nice documentation (in a proper english!)
- Build a better front page

Than the features which would be awesome to implement:

- Use WebRTC with fallback to WebSocket if not available
- Use custom remote UIs that developers can create and host
- Theming possibilities on remote
- Backend to manage keys
- Split code into different repo, making it easier for devs to hack the piece of code required
