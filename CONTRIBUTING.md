# Contribute

There's different ways to contribute to liwe, and you are all welcome! *as long as you're constructive and not a troll ;-)*

Before all, I know this repo will get a crazy amount of pull request to fix and review the documentation. The grammar is awful, I know. But this time I don't want to do the same mistake as I did with [vivus](http://github.com/maxwellito/vivus). This time it would be awsome to have one or two official contributers, with english for mother tongue, who will be charge of reviewing, modifying and correcting whatever piece of documentation.

## For Developers

At the moment, the project is a prototype. We accept pull requests about bug fixing but not new feature implementation. Join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/liwe) to to give your feedback and point of view about the project. First we want to design the app: protocol, packages and frameworks to use, and new features to implement. Please check `PLAN.md` file.

## For Users

You are part of the development too. Your feedback is really important to us. Please tell us how was your experience, what you would like to see, what you hated.. Of course I don't expect you to open a GitHub account to share your point of view (I don't even know how you arrived on this page, but congratulation for your curiosity). Feel free to tweet the creator at @mxwllt on twitter.

## For Magicians

If you're a graphist, UX designer, UI designer and want to be involved in the project: please come! You are more than welcome. And that would be such an honor to see people like you involved into open source projects. Feel free to tweet us some mockups, or join the conversation to explain what you feel wroung about the project and how to improve it.
